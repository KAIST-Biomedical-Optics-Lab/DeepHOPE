# DeepHOPE (Deep-learning-guided HOlotomography for Pluripotency Evaluation)
This repository contains codes, models, and data for demonstrating DeepHOPE, which is an integrated pipeline of holotmographic imaging and deep-learning image recognition for assessing the stemness of an hPSC colony.

## Environment
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

```shell
conda activate env_DeepHOPE
``` 

## Data directory example
One can explicitely use the directory structure below or use yaml files (i.e., data_train.yaml, data_val.yaml, data_test.yaml; example is provided) that contain the file paths and classes
```shell

## Training the neural network

```shell

python3 train.py --config "path to your config file"

```

## Inference with the trained neural network

```shell

python3 infer.py --config "path to your config file"

```


## Editting the config file
A config file is a yaml file of the following format, that governs the process of either training (train.py) or inference (infer.py).
